Title: DES Algorithm Implementation üîê

Description:
This project demonstrates the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, a symmetric key encryption technique. It includes:

Key generation (random/user-defined, securely stored in a file)
Padding mechanism to ensure data aligns with block size
Encryption & decryption of user-inputted plaintext
Security considerations, highlighting DES limitations and the need for stronger encryption like AES
This implementation provides hands-on experience with cryptography fundamentals.
